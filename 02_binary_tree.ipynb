    "# Binary Tree \n",
    "Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have 0, 1 or 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.\n",

    "\n",
    "A tree contains the following terms:\n",
    "- **Root:** The root of a tree is the topmost node of the tree that has no parent node. There is only one root node in every tree.\n",
    "- **Edge:** Edge acts as a link between the parent node and the child node.\n",
    "- **Leaf:** A node that has no child is known as the leaf node. It is the last node of the tree. There can be multiple leaf nodes in a tree.\n",
    "- **Subtree:** The subtree of a node is the tree considering that particular node as the root node.\n",
    "- **Depth:** The depth of the node is the distance from the root node to that particular node.\n",
    "- **Height:** The height of the node is the distance from that node to the deepest node of that subtree.\n",
    "- **Height of tree:** The Height of the tree is the maximum height of any node. This is same as the height of root node\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation of binary tree\n",
    "A binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree. If the tree is empty then the value of the root is NULL. A binary tree contains the following parts\n",

    "- Pointer to left child\n",
